A pocketmine plugin, that will let players get head by killing players and redeem rewards from the head
# Configuration
You can mostly setup everything in the config.yml file
# Guide
The rewards will work according to the opponent money, that will be calculated by a percentage you can edit in config `money-percent` option to setup the percentage you want.
You can change `reduce-money` from config to rather enable or disable reducing money from the opponent who's head you are redeeming
